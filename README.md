A simple game using the PlayN framework.

Instructions
============

Rotate your ship using the left and right arrows.  Apply thrust using the spacebar.  Collect the debris falling into the
black hole to score points and replenish your fuel.  If you get sucked into the black hole, it will drain your fuel
quickly.  If you reach zero fuel while touching the black hole, it's game over.
